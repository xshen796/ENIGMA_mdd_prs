## Summary

These need to be prepared:

-   Summary statistics

-   SNP list(s)

-   A file to indicate inputs (a file called 'input.txt' in the *data* folder)

Details can be found below. An input file should be stored in the *data* folder. Other items are recommended to put in the *data* folder but it is not mandatory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary statistics

A summary statistic (base dataset) file should be a tab-deliminated, plain text file. Column names are essential for PRSice2.0. Please use the default column names in the [PRSice2.0 tutorial](https://www.prsice.info/step_by_step/#base-dataset).

For example (ref: <https://www.prsice.info/step_by_step/#base-dataset>):

| SNP       | CHR | BP     | A1  | A2  | OR     | SE     | P      |
|-----------|-----|--------|-----|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| rs3094315 | 1   | 752566 | A   | G   | 0.9912 | 0.0229 | 0.7009 |
| rs3131972 | 1   | 752721 | A   | G   | 1.007  | 0.0228 | 0.769  |
| rs3131971 | 1   | 752894 | T   | C   | 1.003  | 0.0232 | 0.8962 |

### SNP list(s)

SNP list is used for restricting which SNPs used for calculating PRS. It should be a single column of SNPs **without** a column name.

Example:

> rs3094315
>
> rs3131972
>
> rs3131971

### An input list

A file called 'input.txt' in the *data* folder should contain a table of inputs for each PRS.

The file should be a tab-deliminated, plain text file. It should have three columns:

-   File locations for SNP list(s)

-   File location for summary statistics

-   Method used for calculating PRS: CT/sbayesr (CT=clumping+thresholding; sbayesr=SBayesR)

    If CT was given for the method column, clumping would be applied. If sbayesr was given, no clumping would be applied.

Example:

> data/SNP_all_hardlist data/summstats/mdd_summstats.example CT
>
> data/SNP_all_hardlist data/summstats/mdd_summstats.example sbayesr

In this example, two PRSs will be generated. For example, the first one will be generated using SNPs from the 'data/SNP_all_hardlist' file, sumstats from the 'data/summstats/mdd_summstats.example' file and clumping+thresholding method. You could also find an example file [here](https://github.com/xshen796/ENIGMA_mdd_prs/tree/main/data/example.input.txt).

This PRSs will be stored in the 'data/SNP_all_hardlist_mdd_summstats.example_CT.all_score' file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Outputs

All outputs will be generated in the *PRS* folder.

Here's a rough checklist:

-   A 'log.txt' file generated by the pipeline

-   GRM files

-   PRS files
