# MDD PRS

This repository was made to summarise scripts for preparing genetic data and calculating polygenic risk scores.

## Prepare GWAS summary statistics:

Change SNP names from CHR:BP to RS format: https://github.com/xshen796/ENIGMA_mdd_prs/blob/main/script/PREP_genetic/SNP_rsID.md


## Polygenic risk scores
Create polygenic risk scores: https://github.com/xshen796/ENIGMA_mdd_prs/blob/main/script/PREP_PRS/Calculate_PRS.md


## Set up a polygenic risk score project
For project leaders: https://github.com/xshen796/ENIGMA_mdd_prs/blob/main/script/PREP_PRS/Set_up_a_PRSproject.md
